Intervisibility graph creation:
 - Determining if point p is visibile from point q is REALLY slow (even after using do_intersect instead of intersect).
 - Creating tangent points is also really slow.
   - Both problems might be due to the fact new objects are created to run the given functions.
 - Predecessors don't seem to work yet
